# To do List app 
## Welcome to my [To do list app](https://my-to-do-list-a8066c712807.herokuapp.com/)


## Introduction:
The purpose of developing this app is to keep track of our current and future appointments/plans. It is very important for each and everyone of us to stay organized and manage our day to day tasks effectively. I believe this app would help us achieve the same.

## Main features of this app:

* Adding tasks: Users can add new tasks with a deadline.
* Viewing tasks: Users can view their existing tasks in a list format.
* Deleting tasks: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
* Updating tasks: Users can edit existing tasks, by modifying the task description and deadline.

# Features:

   * This app is fully developed using Python.
 * Visual Studio Code
   * This website was developed using Gitpod IDE and also used the code institute template.
 * Github
   * Source code is hosted on GitHub.
 * Git
   * Used to commit and push code during the development of the Website.

## UX Design

### User Story:
As a busy Home maker, mother and a student, I want to use a to-do list app to organize my tasks and stay on top of my daily activities. 

#### As an User:
* I want the app to add the task with a deadline.
* I want the app to list down all the tasks in the database.
* I want the app to delete the task which is no longer needed.
* I want the app to allow me to edit the existing task.
* I want the app to validate the input datas like date and have a control over the length of the task.
* I want a message after every action when successfully implemented.
* I want a error message incase of invalid data.

#### As the App Administrator:

* I want the app to be presentable as well as readable.
* I want the app to be user friendly.
* I want the output to be clear and not clumpsy.
* I want the user to differentiate between valid and invalid data received by adding text colors.
* I want the app to display the task in a numerical order.

### Acceptance Criteria:

* Adding Tasks:

  * I should be able to add a new task to my list.
When adding a task, I should provide a brief description and specify a deadline.

* Viewing Tasks:

  * I should be able to view all my tasks in a clear and organized manner.
Each task should display its description and deadline.

* Deleting Tasks:

  * I should be able to remove a task from my list if I no longer need to complete it.

* Updating Tasks:

  * I should be able to edit the description or deadline of an existing task if needed.

* Validation:

  * The app should validate user inputs to ensure task descriptions are not empty and deadlines are in the correct format.
Error messages should be displayed clearly to guide me in correcting any mistakes.

- `tabulate` from the Tabulate library for displaying data in tabular format.
- `gspread` for interacting with Google Sheets.
- `Credentials` from the Google OAuth2 library for handling authentication.


## Features Planned to Implement in Future:

* From single user need to extend it to multiple user.

## Deployment:

### Version Control:
* The site is created using the Gitpod IDE and then added and commited to git. Later pushed to github.
* The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:
  * git add <file>/.- This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.
  * git commit -m “commit message” - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.
  * git push - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

  ### Deployment to Heroku:
